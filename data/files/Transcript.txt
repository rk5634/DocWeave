User Query - What is HIV, and how is it different from AIDS?

HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is a retrovirus that attacks and destroys certain white blood cells essential to the immune system. AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is a condition that results from the progression of HIV infection, characterized by a pattern of severe infections and other health issues.

Individuals who are HIV-positive may not show symptoms and can remain healthy for years without having AIDS. However, over time, the virus can become active and lead to the serious infections and conditions associated with AIDS. Thus, HIV is the virus that causes the disease, while AIDS is the syndrome that develops as a result of untreated HIV infection.

User Query - What are the main ways HIV is transmitted according to this document?

The main ways HIV is transmitted according to the document are:

Sexual intercourse (anal and vaginal).
Contaminated blood and blood products, tissues, and organs.
Contaminated needles, syringes, and other piercing instruments.
Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT).

User Query - How effective are condoms, and are all types recommended?

Condoms, particularly latex condoms lubricated with silicone or water-based lubricant, are recommended as an effective barrier method to reduce the risk of HIV transmission during anal, vaginal, and oral intercourse. However, they are only effective if used properly and do not break.

Natural membrane condoms, made from sheep gut, are not recommended because they have tiny pores that can allow HIV to pass through.

For maximum effectiveness, condoms should be put on before any part of the penis touches the rectum, vagina, or mouth, and care should be taken during withdrawal to avoid spillage.

Female condoms, such as the REALITY condom, are also available and are made of polyurethane, which is not latex.

In summary, while latex condoms are effective when used correctly, natural membrane condoms are not recommended, and female condoms are an alternative option.

User Query - How long after infection can HIV be reliably detected?

HIV can be reliably detected through testing after an average of 25 days following infection. More than 99 percent of infected individuals will show a positive result after three months.

User Query - What does the document say about the global scale of the HIV epidemic?

The document states that the global scale of the HIV epidemic is significant and alarming. By the end of 1998, an estimated 33.4 million people were living with HIV, with the majority unaware of their infection. The epidemic is described as being out of control in many regions, particularly in the developing world, where over 95 percent of all HIV-infected individuals reside. This area has also experienced 95 percent of all AIDS-related deaths, primarily among young adults in their productive and reproductive years. The repercussions of these deaths are reaching crisis levels, affecting child survival, life expectancy, health care systems, and increasing orphanhood. The document highlights that virtually every country saw new infections in 1998, indicating that the epidemic has not been overcome anywhere.
